# About

## Project:

## Tasks to be done:

- ability to READ files in a certain directory;

# Installation process (using git bash)

- create an empty fresh folder on e.g. Desktop;
- open that folder e.g. via VSCode editor;
- clone my project using this link: git clone https://github.com/MariusStrumyla/BIT-sprint6.git

- now you will need some kind of a web server app. If you will use one called "XAMPP":

   * place the folder you cloned before into "xampp/htdocs/" directory;
   * start "apache" server in "XAMPP";
   * opne your browser and type "localhost/BIT-SPRINT6/" and press enter;
   * log in credentials are written as a placeholder text in a form;
